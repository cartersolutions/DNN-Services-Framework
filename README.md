DNN 7.3.2 Services Framework
===
This is a Visual Studio 2013 solution containing two projects - DNNAwesome and DNNAwesomeServices. They demonstrate how to use DNN Service Framework, Entity Framework and jQuery to create an awesome user interface. 

I suggest you use the solution with the latest version of DNN and the default Bootstrap Gravity skin for the best experience.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>DNNAwesome</h3>
This is the DNN module that is installed and contains all the user interface code
<h3>DNNAwesomeService</h3>
This is the assembly that contains web services exposed by the DNN Services Framework and the Entity Framework
